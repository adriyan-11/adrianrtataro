       <h1>History of Taytay Senior High School</h1>
  <h2>History of School</h2>
  <h3>
    As prescribed by Republic Act 10533 known as Basic Education Act of 2013 which ensures that students are equipped for workforce readiness and that the country’s educational system won’t lag behind world standards.  DepEd Rizal took its part in laying down the foundation in the implementation of establishing Taytay  Senior High School Stand-Alone through planning and orientation sessions. The Senior High School of the Municipality of Taytay is still unconstructed that is why the municipality opted to temporarily integrate Senior High School to address the problem. Three different public secondary schools in Taytay, namely Taytay National High School under Mr. Ricardo C. Vergara as principal, Manuel I. Santos Memorial National High School under Mr. Virgilio P. Ramos and Benjamin B. Esguerra Memorial National High School under Dr. Rebecca F. Averion accomodated the first batch of Senior High School Grade 11 students school year 2016-2017.  The institution is now known as Taytay Senior High School and is housed at  #14  Camia St., Brgy. Sta Ana Taytay, Rizal with Dr. Dennis Niño A. Ancheta as the school head from June 2017 to October 2018.<br>

       Taytay Senior High School offers several Academic Tracks like ABM, HUMSS, STEM and soon to offer GAS, the school also offers sports; and Technology Vocational and Livelihood (TVL) track with specialization in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Bread and Pastry, Cookery, Food and Beverage and Shielded-Arc Metal Welding, Dressmaking and Beauty Care.<br>

     Presently, the school is under the supervision of Mrs. Nenita De Leon as principal — the school head of TaySenHigh.
