       <h1>History of Taytay Senior High School</h1>
  <h2>History of School</h2>
  <h3>
    The Basic Education Act of 2013, also known as Republic Act 10533, guarantees that students are prepared for the workforce and that the educational system of the country does not fall behind global standards. Planning and orientation sessions were conducted by DepEd Rizal to establish Taytay Senior High School Stand-Alone. In order to resolve the issue, the municipality of Taytay has elected to provisionally integrate the Senior High School, which is still under construction. The initial cohort of Senior High School Grade 11 students for the 2016-2017 academic year was accommodated by three distinct public secondary schools in Taytay: Taytay National High School, which was led by Mr. Ricardo C. Vergara, Manuel I. Santos Memorial National High School, which was led by Mr. Virgilio P. Ramos, and Benjamin B. Esguerra Memorial National High School, which was managed by Dr. Rebecca F. Averion. Taytay Senior High School, which was previously located at #14 Camia St., Brgy. Sta Ana Taytay, Rizal, was initially led by Dr. Dennis Ni√±o A. Ancheta from June 2017 to October 2018.<br>

 Presently, it is situated at #21 B. Pag-asa Street, Brgy. Dolores Taytay, Rizal. Taytay Senior High School provides a variety of academic tracks, including ABM, HUMSS, STEM, and GAS. The school also offers sports. The Technology Vocational and Livelihood (TVL) track is focused on Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Bread and Pastry, Cookery, Food and Beverage, Shielded-Arc Metal Welding, Dressmaking, and Beauty Care.<br>

 Currently, Mrs. Nenita De Leon serves as the principal of Taytay Senior High School.  </h3> <br>
